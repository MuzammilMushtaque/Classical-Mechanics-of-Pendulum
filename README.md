# Double Pendulum Simulation

This project simulates the motion of a double pendulum and creates an animated video to visualize its behavior. The simulation is implemented in Python, utilizing the matplotlib and imageio libraries for plotting and video creation.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to showcase the dynamic motion of a double pendulum system. The simulation generates a series of frames depicting the positions of the two pendula over time and compiles them into an animated video.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- matplotlib
- numpy
- imageio

1. Run the simulation:


This will generate a series of frames in the "images" directory and compile them into an animated video named "output_video.mp4."

## Customization

You can customize the simulation by adjusting parameters such as pendulum lengths (`L1` and `L2`) and initial angles (`phi1` and `phi2`). Explore the code and experiment with different values to observe how they impact the double pendulum motion.

## Examples

Sample images and the final video output can be found in the "images" and "output_video.mp4" files, respectively.


## Acknowledgments

- The simulation is based on the principles of classical mechanics and the equations governing the motion of a double pendulum.

Feel free to update and expand the simulator with complex pendulum behavior.
